# Vivacity Tech Software Engineer Application - Backend Code by Brandon Lisonbee

Welcome to the backend application that sends information about me to a corresponding frontend react application!
This repository contains code written in typescript on a Node.js framework to create a very simple API with one route that sends JSON data to a frontend react application.

This is simply a demonstration of my skills as a Software Engineer and is not meant to be anything more complex than a simple tech demo.
